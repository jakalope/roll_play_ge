I enjoy making small RPGs with my son. Existing tile-based RPG engines are missing
a lot of the features we want, such as in-map battles and a built-in mobile platform
UI, not to mention reasonable resource allocation and runtimes.

Proposed feature list:
- Third party compatibility
 - [x] Support for a third party map editor: http://www.mapeditor.org/ 
 - [ ] Support for a third party asset manager
- User interface
 - [ ] Keyboard UI
 - [ ] Touch UI
- Battle system
 - [ ] In-map battles
 - [ ] Malay attacks
 - [ ] Projectiles
 - [ ] Guard/protect
- Scene control
 - [ ] Custom lighting
 - [ ] Character text and thought bubbles

This project's example assets originated from [here](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston-examples/tree/master/tiled).
