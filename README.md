I enjoy making small RPGs with my son. Existing tile-based RPG engines are missing
a lot of the features we want, such as in-map battles and a built-in mobile platform
UI, not to mention reasonable resource allocation and runtimes.

Proposed feature list:
- [x] Support for a third party map editor: http://www.mapeditor.org/ 
- [ ] Support for a third party asset manager
- [ ] Keyboard UI
- [ ] Touch UI
- [ ] In-map battles

This project's example assets originated from [here](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston-examples/tree/master/tiled).
