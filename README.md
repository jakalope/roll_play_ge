# RollPlayGE

I enjoy making small RPGs with my son. Existing tile-based RPG engines are missing
a lot of the features we want, such as in-map battles and a built-in mobile platform
UI. Thus, this project aims to glue together the pieces necessary to make a better
2D-tile-based game engine.

## Proposed feature list:

### Third party compatibility
 - [x] Support for a third party map editor: http://www.mapeditor.org/ 
 - [ ] Support for a third party asset manager

### User interface
 - [ ] Keyboard UI
 - [ ] Touch UI

### Battle system
 - [ ] In-map battles
 - [ ] Malay attacks
 - [ ] Projectiles
 - [ ] Guard/protect

### Scene control
 - [ ] Custom lighting
 - [ ] Character text and thought bubbles

## Credits

* Example assets originated from [here](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston-examples/tree/master/tiled).
* The developers of [Piston](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston) have done a lot of the groundwork for me.
