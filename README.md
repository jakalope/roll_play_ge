# RollPlayGE

I enjoy making small RPGs with my son. Existing tile-based RPG engines are missing
a lot of the features we want, such as in-map battles and a built-in mobile platform
UI. Thus, this project aims to glue together the pieces necessary to make a better
2D-tile-based game engine.

## Proposed feature list:

### Third party compatibility
 - [x] Support for a third party map editor: http://www.mapeditor.org/ 
 - [ ] Support for third party sprite sheet animation: https://www.aseprite.org/

### User interface
 - [x] Keyboard UI
 - [ ] Touch UI

### Battle system
 - [ ] In-map battles
 - [ ] Malay attacks
 - [ ] Projectiles
 - [ ] Guard/protect

### Map system
 - [ ] Character remains in center
 - [ ] End-of-world methods: Solid, Textured, Wrap

### Scene control
 - [ ] Custom lighting
 - [ ] Character speech- and thought-bubbles
